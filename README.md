## Introduction

Check the Dex is a React Native Expo app that allows users to search for pokemon they like and add them to an account that they make when they register.  

## Getting Started

To set up and run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iFernandez96/SoftwareEngineeringProject1.git
   cd SoftwareEngineeringProject1
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Application**

   Launch the app using Expo:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Using the App

Currently only mobile works because expolite database doesn't support the web app version. To run the app, either scan the QR code on your mobile phone or open up [Expo Orbit](https://docs.expo.dev/build/orbit/) which uses an android emulator. If you need an android emulator, you can download one through android studio. 

In order to use the app, you must first create an account, then you are able to use the app. Have fun!
