#### What was your role / which stories did you work on

My role was mainly taking care of the login page and signup page. That involved the front and back end for it. I also did work on the profile page. I took care of the stories Login Page, Verifying user credentials, Add sessions, and Authentication State.

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
The biggest challenge for me was understanding the data base and how to interact with it.
+ Why was it a challenge?
It was a challenge because I needed it to do a lot of my work and I had difficulty understanding it at first.
  + How was the challenge addressed?
  I talked with Israel who worked on the database and he helped me understand how it worked and what was causing my issue.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
My favorite part of this project was the fact that it was an ios app and we were able to test it on our phones.
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
If I could do it over I would change the way we broke down and assigned work, at first we thought it was optimal but towards the end we began thinking of more additions we would like and probably should have spent more time on the initial design and thought process.
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
The most valuable thing I learned is that I enjoy the work setup we had. Working in one week sprints or iterations was actually really enjoyable and helped balance out the workload and forced me to not be able to procrastinate which I found really enjoyable.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
Carol mostly worked on getting the app to run faster, better, and higher.  She did the best work possible but her contributions were overpowered and not well received by the fans.

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + Managing pull requests and merges
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + We were all new to git/github and not everyone followed convention
  + How was the challenge addressed?
  + I went to the TA for help and used ChatGPT and web resources to get more comfortable with git.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + Finally getting the IDs from the API calls to store in the ROOM database
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would get the ROOM database setup FIRST
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + Do the work early and document EVERYTHING


## Conclusion

- How successful was the project?
I think the project turned out successful, we implemented everything we originally thought of and the app runs as intended.
  - Think in terms of what did you set out to do and what actually got done?
  I think in terms of our original goals we completed what we wanted, towards the end we thought of some quality of life features that we really wish we were able to implement.
- What was the largest victory?
The largest victory was probably getting the database working and being able to store users favorites unique to their own profile.
- Final assessment of the project
The project was a success, it handles the original features we had in mind and in the end is a working product with the core functions we were hoping to have from the beginning.
