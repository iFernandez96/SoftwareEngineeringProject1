# Check the Dex

Welcome to Check the Dex, a React Native Expo application.

Authors: Abel Delgadom Eric Rios, Jaden Bartram, Israel Fernandez

## Overview

Check the Dex is a React Native Expo app that allows users to search for pokemon they like and add them to an account that they make when they register. We make use of the PokeApi. 

## Getting Started

To set up and run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iFernandez96/SoftwareEngineeringProject1.git
   cd SoftwareEngineeringProject1
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Application**

   Launch the app using Expo:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Using the App

Currently only mobile works because expolite database doesn't support the web app version. To run the app, either scan the QR code on your mobile phone or open up [Expo Orbit](https://docs.expo.dev/build/orbit/) which uses an android emulator. If you need an android emulator, you can download one through android studio. 

In order to use the app, you must first create an account, then you are able to use the app. Have fun!

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
My role focused on attaching PokeApi functionality to our project. I mainly worked on pokeApi.ts, pokemon.tsx, and pokedex.tsx.

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
   + I had previously worked with this API before so my biggest challenge came with trying to figure out how to work with React Native itself.

+ Why was it a challenge?
   + It was a challenge as I had never used it before. Thankfully, I had taken Database and Internet programming prior so I did not run into too much difficulty there.

+ How was the challenge addressed?
   + Had to look up documentation via links provided, but after getting used to useState and useEffect, I just had to figure out formatting and I was good to go.

+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
   + Favorite part was just working on getting the pokedex up and running, and having all 151 original populate the page. Having our project be Pokemon centered definitely gave me more motivation to work on it as I still enjoy the idea of Pokemon.

+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
   + I would definitely take more time to actually go more in depth with the pokemon themselves. As it is now, it just shows their sprites and some basic stats. I would have liked to be more detailed and give each pokemon an actual page with additional information.

+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
   + Definitely just working with React Native as it gives me hands-on experience with a tool I was unfamiliar with before.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
My role was to manage the database and help with integrating the UI with the database.
+ What was the biggest challenge?
   + I found the biggest challenge was getting the database to work and be easy to work with.
+ Why was it a challenge?
   + It was a learning experience and required a learning curve. I had to spend a lot of time to just learn the basics of React before I can move to react native. I also had to learn Typescript which required me to get better at javascript in order to work on the database.
+ How was the challenge addressed?
   + I have plenty of resources to learn React. Fireship.io, youtube, udemy, and the react native expo documentation was instrumental to my success.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
   + My favourite part of this project was learning how to work in it. I really like the idea of being able to write once, then run on multiple platforms.
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
   + I would dedicate more time in organizing the code and sectioning off different parts of the code.
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
   + I learned react! Its been on my list to learn, so it is nice to be able to actually get kicked into gear for learning it.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on?
My role was to set up navigation, which involved working on the bottom navigation bar and making sure routes were properly connected. I also worked on implementing pokemon songs using an interactive button and many other UI changes.
+ What was the biggest challenge?
   + The biggest challenge was making sure everyone was on the same page and learning to react native for the first time.
+ Why was it a challenge?
   + Getting used to coding in javascript and typescript was challenging. Also, sometimes we had different depictions of what we imagined the app to be, so sometimes we would get confused.
+ How was the challenge addressed?
   + We would communicate very effectively and if anyone was confused or had an issue we worked together to get it resolved.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
   + My favorite part of the project was implementing the pokemon songs to the app
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
   + If I were to do it over again, I would try adding sound effects of each pokemon when clicked upon.
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
   + I believe the most valuable thing I learned was learning how to use React Native and javascript/typescript.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
My role was mainly taking care of the login page and signup page. That involved the front and back end for it. I also did work on the profile page. I took care of the stories Login Page, Verifying user credentials, Add sessions, and Authentication State.
+ What was the biggest challenge?
   + The biggest challenge for me was understanding the data base and how to interact with it.
+ Why was it a challenge?
   + It was a challenge because I needed it to do a lot of my work and I had difficulty understanding it at first.
+ How was the challenge addressed?
   + I talked with Israel who worked on the database and he helped me understand how it worked and what was causing my issue.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
   + My favorite part of this project was the fact that it was an ios app and we were able to test it on our phones.
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
   + If I could do it over I would change the way we broke down and assigned work, at first we thought it was optimal but towards the end we began thinking of more additions we would like and probably should have spent more time on the initial design and thought process.
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
   + The most valuable thing I learned is that I enjoy the work setup we had. Working in one week sprints or iterations was actually really enjoyable and helped balance out the workload and forced me to not be able to procrastinate which I found really enjoyable.

## Conclusion
- How successful was the project?
While we couldnâ€™t fit our initial vision entirely such as soundbites and team comps, we still got the majority of what we set out to accomplish so overall we feel satisfied with our project. We set out to make a Pokedex app that lets users save Pokemon they own and favorite them as well and we believe our app hits those points.

- What was the largest victory?
Getting the database to work. Setting it up was different from what we were familiar with, and early implementations broke the project initially, but finally getting it to work allowed us to move forwards on user authentication and pokedex functionality.

- Final assessment of the project
Overall we managed to accomplish all the major goals of our project so we consider the final product, while on the simpler side, to be successful in its current state.
